This program is a simple personal CRM written in Python, so I can keep track of my network.

Key info (hopefully most will be imported from linkedin)

First Name
Last Name
Email
Phone
Current Job
School
Veteran
Date met
A catchall notes section that I can easily add to

I also want to be able to put people in various groups
